The world surely doesn't need more static site generators, but I'm trying my best to make this one the simplest of them all. Previously, I was using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/" target="_blank">Pelican</a> for a few years to generate this site. However, I always felt it was a bit too big with too many features for me. In addition, when not using it for a while it took too long *getting into*. Therefore, I decided it was time to build something much simpler myself: <a href="https://github.com/mgcth/mysgen" target="_blank">mysgen</a>. It takes posts and pages as markdown files and generates html files according to a template (built with <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank">Jinja2</a>).
