Samsung Galaxy S10, 4.3mm (26mm)

1/1532, f/2.4, ISO 50

Coincidently, <a href="https://images.samsung.com/se/smartphones/galaxy-s10/camera/images/galaxy-s10_camera_tele-camera_img01.jpg" target="_blank">the same location was used by Samsung in their advertisement of this phone</a> (from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/se/smartphones/galaxy-s10/camera/" target="_blank">https://www.samsung.com/se/smartphones/galaxy-s10/camera/</a>). I find the marketing fair.
